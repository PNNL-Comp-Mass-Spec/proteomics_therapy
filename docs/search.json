    "section": "1.5 Compiling Packages from Source",
    "text": "1.5 Compiling Packages from Source\nTo compile R packages from source, you need to install the necessary development tools. This is particularly useful if you want to install the latest versions of packages, or if binary versions are not available for your operating system. Some R packages contain C, C++, or Fortran code that needs to be compiled into machine code to run efficiently. By compiling from source, you can ensure compatibility and potentially gain performance improvements.\n\n1.5.1 Why Compiling from Source is Necessary\n\nAccess to Latest Features and Fixes: Some packages may have newer versions available that contain important bug fixes or new features. These updates may not yet be available in precompiled binary formats. This is common in research computing.\nCompatibility: Certain packages or systems might not have precompiled binaries available, especially on less common operating systems. Building from source ensures you can still use these packages.\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Compiling Packages on Windows (Rtools)\nRtools is a collection of tools necessary for building R packages on Windows.\n\nGo to the Rtools download page.\nDownload the appropriate version of Rtools corresponding to your R version. (i.e. “Rtools44 installer”)\nRun the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.\nIn the R console (see RStudio) run Sys.which(\"make\") and see if it finds a make.exe file. If so, you’re good to go. If not, proceed to the next step.\nAdd Rtools to your system PATH:\n\nOpen the “System Properties” window by right-clicking on “This PC” and selecting “Properties.”\nClick on “Advanced system settings” and then on the “Environment Variables” button.\nUnder “System variables,” find the “Path” variable, select it, and click “Edit.”\nClick “New” and add the path to the Rtools bin directory (e.g., C:\\Rtools\\bin).\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Compiling Packages on macOS\nTo compile R packages from source on macOS, you only need to install Xcode Command Line Tools:\n\nOpen a Terminal window.\n\nYou may find this program by clicking the Spotlight Search icon (magnifying glass) in your menu bar, then search for “Terminal”.\nOtherwise, it can be found in Finder &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities\n\nCopy and paste the following into the terminal, then press enter: sudo xcode-select --install. You may need to input your password. (If so, no characters will appear.)\nFollow any onscreen instructions and wait for it to finish.\n\nYou can now compile R packages!",
